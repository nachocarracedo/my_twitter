### Analyze a twitter account

I wanted to understand my twitter account, things like:

* Where are the people I follow from
* What are the most common words used?
* What about hastags?
* What kind of tweets are there?

The goal is to present all this information through visualizations.

Bonus: tweet topics (LDA) and sentiment analysis.
