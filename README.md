### Analyze a twitter account

I wanted to understand my twitter account, things like:

* Where are the people I follow from
* What are the most common words used?
* What about hashtags?
* What kind of tweets are there?
* Sentiment analysis (logistic regression)

The goal is to present all this information through visualizations.

Bonus: tweet topics (LDA)

Files:

* twitter.ipynb: Notebook where I used as scratch paper to clean data, EDA, and to play with the plots. Also I played a bit with LDA to extract tweet topics.

* my_twitter_viz.ipynb: I put all together to get 1 final viz.

Here is the visualization for my twitter account (200 for each of the accounts I follow):
